## Master in AI Projects

The following repository contains my student projects for the **Master in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Bologna**. More information about the programme and its teaching contents can be found [here](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence/course-structure-diagram/piano/2021/9063/000/000/2020). 

The projects were done for the course exams to deepen my practical knowledge of the theories taught.

### Image Processing and Computer Vision
- [Fruit Inspection](https://github.com/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/fruit-inspection/main.ipynb)\
  Developed a program to locate defects and imperfections on fruits.
  
- [Product Recognition](https://github.com/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/product-recognition/main.ipynb)\
  Developed a program to identify products on a store shelf using keypoint descriptors.

### Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimisation
- [Lockdown Optimisation](https://github.com/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/lockdown-optimisation/main.ipynb)\
  Developed a program to optimise a government's stay-at-home policy during the COVID pandemic using nonlinear programming.
  
- [VLSI Design](https://github.com/LeonidasY/vlsi-design)\
  Developed a program to solve a VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) problem using constraint programming.
  
### Deep Learning
- [Food Recognition Challenge](https://github.com/lucamarini22/food-recognition-challenge)\
  Developed a program to perform semantic segmentation of different food objects.
  
### Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation
- [State Collapse Network](https://github.com/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/state-collapse-network/main.ipynb)\
  Developed a program to model the conditional dependencies between the causes of a state's collapse using a Bayesian network.
  
### Natural Language Processing
- [Hate Speech Spreader Detection](https://github.com/annafabris/Hate-Speech-Spreader-Detection)\
  Developed a program to detect hate speech spreaders on Twitter.
  
### Artificial Intelligence in Industry
- [Medical Papers Summarisation](https://github.com/LIA-UniBo/medical-papers-summarisation)\
  Developed a program to perform abstractive summarisation of long-form medical papers.
  
### Multi-Agent Systems
- [Collaborating NLP Agents](https://gitlab.com/pika-lab/courses/mas/projects/mas-project-mizutani-gee-ay2122/-/tree/main)\
  Developed a program to train a series of classifiers for solving a named-entity recognition task.
