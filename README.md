## Master AI Projects

The following repository contains my student projects for the **Master in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Bologna**. More information about the programme and its teaching contents can be found [here](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence/course-structure-diagram/piano/2021/9063/000/000/2021). 

The projects were done for the course exams to deepen my practical knowledge of the theories taught.

### Image Processing and Computer Vision
- [Fruit Inspection](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/fruit-inspection/fruit-inspection.ipynb?flush_cache=True)\
  Develop a computer vision system aimed at locating defects and imperfections on fruits.
  
- [Product Recognition](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/product-recognition/product-recognition.ipynb?flush_cache=True)\
  Develop a computer vision system to identify instances of a product from images of a store shelf using keypoint descriptors.
  
### Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation
- [State Collapse Network](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/state-collapse-network/state-collapse-network.ipynb?flush_cache=True)\
  Develop a Bayesian network to model and study the conditional dependencies between the causes of a state's collapse.

### Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimisation
- [Lockdown Optimisation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/lockdown-optimisation/lockdown-optimisation.ipynb?flush_cache=True)\
  Optimise a government's stay at home policy during the COVID pandemic using non-linear programming.
