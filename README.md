## Master AI Projects

The following repository contains my student projects for the **Master in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Bologna**. More information about the programme and its teaching contents can be found [here](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence/course-structure-diagram/piano/2021/9063/000/000/2020). 

The projects were done for the course exams to deepen my practical knowledge of the theories taught.

### Image Processing and Computer Vision
- [Fruit Inspection](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/fruit-inspection/fruit-inspection.ipynb?flush_cache=false)\
  Develop a computer vision system aimed at locating defects and imperfections on fruits.
  
- [Product Recognition](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/product-recognition/product-recognition.ipynb?flush_cache=false)\
  Develop a computer vision system to identify products on a store shelf using keypoint descriptors.

### Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimisation
- [Lockdown Optimisation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/lockdown-optimisation/lockdown-optimisation.ipynb?flush_cache=false)\
  Optimise a government's stay-at-home policy during the COVID pandemic using nonlinear programming.
  
- [VLSI Design](https://github.com/LeonidasY/vlsi-design)\
  Develop a program to solve a VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) problem using constraint programming.
  
### Deep Learning
- [Food Recognition Challenge](https://github.com/lucamarini22/food-recognition-challenge)\
  Develop an image segmentation model to segment and classify different food objects in images.
  
### Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation
- [State Collapse Network](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LeonidasY/master-ai-projects/blob/main/state-collapse-network/state-collapse-network.ipynb?flush_cache=false)\
  Develop a Bayesian network to model the conditional dependencies between the causes of a state's collapse.
  
### Artificial Intelligence in Industry
- [Medical Papers Summarization](https://github.com/LIA-UniBo/medical-papers-summarization)\
  Develop a program to summarize long-form medical papers abstractively.
